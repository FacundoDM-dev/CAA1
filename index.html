            UN launches campaign, calling for renewed global ambition and action
            for the Sustainable Development Goals <br /><br />
            Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in
            September at <b>UN</b> in New York

            <i>New York, 5 July 2023</i> - The United Nations, today, is kicking
            off a communications campaign to rally for the Sustainable
            Development Goals (<b>SDGs</b>), the roadmap for people and planet
            adopted by world leaders in 2015. Ahead of a critical
            <b>UN</b> Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an
            urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the
            blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the
            global public around this shared agenda for our common future.
            <br /><br />
            At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the
            <b>SDGs</b> is in peril. For the first time in decades, development
            progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate
            disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19
            effects. <br /><br />
            The 2023 <b>SDG</b> Summit will gather world leaders at the United
            Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm
            their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave
            no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the
            world back on track to achieving the <b>SDGs</b>. <br /><br />
            Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and
            countries worldwide, the UN campaign aims to re-energize the
            conversation about the Goals.

              that decisionmakers and individual citizens alike will feel
              inspired to join the conversation and contribute to achieving the
              Goals with new resolve and ambition."

            Building off the color wheel brand of the <b>SDGs</b>, the campaign
            uses a dynamic new visual system for its messaging to build
            momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the
            <b>SDGs</b>. <br /><br />
            One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to
            take action on the <b>SDGs</b> through the UNâ€™s ActNow initiative
            across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to
            fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform
            lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the
            <b>SDGs</b> and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.
            <br /><br />
            A curated group of high-profile influencers from entertainment,
            sports and beyond, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their
            social media communities with a combined reach of more than 80
            million globally to take individual action on the <b>SDGs</b> and to
            impress upon decisionmakers the urgency to act now.
